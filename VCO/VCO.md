# Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)

# Credits
I would like to thank [Moritz Klein](https://www.ericasynths.lv/media/VCO_FINAL.pdf) and [Synthmonger](https://electro-music.com/forum/topic-28799.html) for the majority of the design. While not in the PDF linked for the design of the Moritz Klein "Shapes" VCO, the sawtooth-to-triangle waveshaper can be found in [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4r3TTaUKNe0) of his. Also, R.D Middlebrook and I. Richer can be thanked for the triangle-to-sine waveshaper. Tim Stinchcombe covers the circuit for the triangle-to-sine waveshaper on his [website](https://www.timstinchcombe.co.uk/index.php?pge=trisin).
